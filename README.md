Hello there!
My program will be using pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to print a graph. 
The data will be in a dictionary formated style.
The program uses ploting features. The code will label the graph with x-axis, y-axis, title, labels and a graph to reflect teh entered data shown in the code. The data will contain names, age, and income information in order to create teh graph. 

The graph will reflect a blue color as programed. 

The program will call for numpy and pandas to organize the data to put into a graph
